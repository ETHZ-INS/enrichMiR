\usage{
michael(tested, significant, TS, minSize = 3,
  testOnlyAnnotated = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{tested}{The set of tested features (e.g. genes)}

\item{significant}{The set of differentially-expressed features.}

\item{TS}{A data.frame of miRNA targets, with at least the following columns: `family`, `rep.miRNA`, `feature`, `sites`.}

\item{minSize}{The minimum number of targets for a miRNA family to be tested (default 5).}

\item{testOnlyAnnotated}{Whether to excluded features that are bound by no miRNA (default FALSE).}

\item{alternative}{Alternative tested, default "greater" overlap.}
}
\value{
a data.frame.
}
\description{
Applies Fisher's test to the number of miRNA binding sites among a set of features (vs all other binding sites in that set of features).
Of note, this application violates the assumptions of Fisher's exact test.
